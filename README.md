# tSNE
Implemented t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) from scratch using the algorithm outlined in this [Visualizing Data using t-SNE](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf) paper. Tested the algorithm on sets of synthetic data and explored the results of tSNE compared to PCA with regards to data variation and data size.
